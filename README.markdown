Generally useful recipes might be added to compass.

## Building
You can (re-)build the recipes by running `rake`.

## Adding Recipes to the Live Demo
After committing and pushing your changes to the master branch,
all html and css files will be transferred to/updated on the
github pages branch when you run:

    rake pages

Afterwards, you'll be on the `gh-pages` branch where you can edit the index.html file to add links, etc and then push the update.
